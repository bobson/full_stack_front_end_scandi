# Entry React developer TEST - Slobodan Markoski

## Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For the page to work you have to have [junior-react-endpoint](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint) installed and running on your local mashine because I make graphql queries based on Id.

## Available Scripts

1.Install dependencies

2.In the project directory, you can run: `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Live Demo Page

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your local mashine [this link](https://dazzling-sprite-d5ed64.netlify.app/) is a live demo of the task page, but still you have to install and run the [junior-react-endpoint](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint).
